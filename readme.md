üóÇÔ∏è Project summary
Revo Uninstaller Tools bundles powerful uninstall helpers with a focus on complete removal. It includes:

- Force Uninstall: Remove stubborn apps that resist standard uninstallers.
- Residual Cleaner: Sweep up leftovers like files, folders, and registry traces.
- Hunter Mode: Find and firm up remnants tied to running processes, services, or installers.
- Logs Database: Store cleanup actions for auditing and repeatability.

This repository centers on a clean, transparent approach to uninstalling software. It aims to reduce clutter left by incomplete removals and to provide a clear trail of actions taken during cleanup. The tools are designed to work on Windows environments where stubborn uninstall scenarios are common. The project name in the repo reflects a practical set of utilities rather than flashy marketing language. The code is structured for clarity, side-by-side with robust documentation so users can see what the tool does, how it does it, and why certain actions are taken.

If you need a quick glance at what‚Äôs included, you can jump straight to the releases to grab the installer. The latest Windows installer file name is provided in the Releases page, and you can run it to install the suite on your machine.

‚öôÔ∏è Core ideas and design goals

Overview and goals üß≠
Revo Uninstaller Tools is a focused collection of utilities designed to help users cleanly remove software and its traces. The suite addresses common pain points:

- Some programs leave behind files, folders, or registry entries after uninstallation. Residual Cleaner targets these leftovers.
- Some programs use hooks or launchers that hide from standard uninstall chains. Hunter Mode detects and assists with these traces.
- Some software blocks or complicates removal with partial uninstall flows. Force Uninstall attempts a thorough removal while keeping a clear audit trail.
- A Logs Database records actions for auditing, troubleshooting, and learning from cleanup patterns.

The goal is not to replace established uninstallers. It is to complement them with targeted tools that fill gaps. Users gain a predictable workflow when removing stubborn software or cleaning up after removals. The design favors explicit actions and clear feedback. This helps IT admins and power users who need repeatable, auditable cleanup procedures.

Features at a glance üõ†Ô∏è
- Force Uninstall: A robust method for removing stubborn software entries that resist standard uninstallers.
- Residual Cleaner: A scanning and cleanup engine that looks for orphan files, folders, registry keys, and empty leftovers.
- Hunter Mode: An explorer-like mode that helps identify traces that are tied to running processes, services, or recent installations.
- Logs Database: A centralized store for every action taken, including before/after snapshots, detected items, and user decisions.
- Safety prompts and confirmations: Before irreversible actions, the tool explains what it will do.
- Rollback support: When enabled, actions can be reviewed or rolled back if needed.
- Lightweight footprint: Core operations run with minimal system impact.

How the tools work together üîó
- The main interface ties together Force Uninstall, Residual Cleaner, and Hunter Mode.
- You can run each module independently or in a guided sequence to maximize cleanup effectiveness.
- The Logs Database records every step, providing a traceable history that helps with audits and repeat usage.
- The workflow typically starts with identifying the target, validating it with Hunter Mode, attempting complete removal with Force Uninstall, and finishing with Residual Cleaner to catch leftovers.
- If you operate in a managed environment, you can export logs for documentation and compliance.

Getting started üö¶
- Step 1: Visit the releases page to download the installer (the Releases page contains a Windows installer suitable for typical setups). The latest Windows installer should be named something like revo-uninstaller-tools-setup.exe in the releases. You will run the installer to install the suite on your machine.
- Step 2: Run the installer with administrative privileges to ensure it can access all components needed for forceful removal and system cleanup.
- Step 3: Open the main interface and review the modules. Start with Hunter Mode to locate traces that are hidden from standard uninstallers.
- Step 4: Use Force Uninstall to remove the target software. Confirm any prompts that appear to ensure you understand what will be removed.
- Step 5: Run Residual Cleaner to scan for leftovers and clean up files, folders, and registry entries that the initial uninstall may have missed.
- Step 6: Review the Logs Database to verify what actions were taken. You can export log data for your records if needed.

Note about the releases link
- The link provided in this README points to the GitHub Releases page for the project. If the link has a path part, the file to download is the installer from the Releases page. You should locate the appropriate asset, such as revo-uninstaller-tools-setup.exe, and download it. The same link appears again as a clickable badge above to support quick navigation.

Implementation details and architecture üß±
- Modules
  - Force Uninstall: This module leverages multiple uninstall strategies. It uses standard uninstall entries as the first line of defense. If that fails, it tries a set of forced removal techniques. The module reports back details of each action, including the status and any errors encountered.
  - Residual Cleaner: It performs a targeted sweep for file system remnants, registry leftovers, and config artifacts. It uses a safe deletion policy by default, with an option to back up items before removal.
  - Hunter Mode: It scans for processes, services, drivers, and startup items that may be tied to the software. It helps the user identify risky traces and decide which ones to remove.
  - Logs Database: It stores each run's data. The schema is simple and extensible. It captures: target identifiers, actions taken, time stamps, results, and user notes.
- Data flow
  - User starts a session and selects a target.
  - Hunter Mode analyzes candidates and presents findings.
  - Force Uninstall executes a plan to remove the core components.
  - Residual Cleaner cleans up leftovers and updates the Logs Database.
  - The session ends with a summary and a store of logs for future reference.
- Error handling
  - Each module handles errors gracefully. The UI reports errors clearly. If a step fails, the system suggests the next safe action.
  - If the operation could harm the system, the tool will warn the user and request confirmation before proceeding.
- Extensibility
  - The design accommodates new cleanup rules, new types of leftovers, and new uninstall strategies.
  - You can add plugins or modules to expand coverage without altering core workflows.

  - You can configure the export format (CSV, JSON) to feed analytics pipelines.

Security, safety, and best practices üîê
- Backups before cleanup
  - Always enable a backup option for critical items. If you remove something unintentionally, you can revert.
- Review before action
  - Review the list of items before you delete or remove them. The tool shows what it will change and why.
- Check the source
  - Use the official releases page to obtain installers. Acknowledge that the download is from a trusted source.
- Data minimization
  - The Logs Database should only collect necessary data. Remove or anonymize data when appropriate.
- Recovery planning
  - Keep a known good restore point or system backup before major cleanup work.

Data handling, logs, and auditing üìä
- Logs Database
  - A dedicated store for actions taken during cleanup.
  - Each run includes a timestamp, the target, modules used, results, and any errors.
  - You can export logs for audits or compliance.
- Privacy considerations
  - Cleanup logs can contain software names, registry paths, and file locations. Treat logs as sensitive data and protect access to them.
- Retention and cleanup
  - Logs can accumulate. Implement retention policies to manage space and privacy. You can archive old logs or delete them on a schedule.

Configuration and customization options ‚öôÔ∏è
- Editor-friendly config
  - The configuration file is human-readable JSON. You can modify defaults safely.
- Profiles
  - Create profiles for different environments: personal PC, a managed workstation, or a test lab.
- Module toggles
  - Enable or disable modules per profile. For example, in a test lab you may want to skip certain aggressive actions.

Troubleshooting and diagnosis üß∞
- Common issues
  - Installer fails to run: Check permissions, disable antivirus temporarily, and re-run as administrator.
  - Hunter Mode misses a trace: Ensure real-time monitoring features are enabled in the system and that you have adequate permissions.
  - Residual Cleaner finds nothing: The software might have already removed the traces, or the leftovers are not in common locations. Consider expanding the search to user profiles.
- Log-based diagnosis
  - Use the Logs Database to review actions. Look for error codes and failed steps. Use the export feature to share logs with support.

Testing, quality, and reliability üß™
- Test plans
  - Unit tests cover each module independently.
  - Integration tests verify workflows from start to finish.
  - UI tests ensure the experience remains intuitive after changes.
